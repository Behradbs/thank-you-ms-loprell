            <p>With utmost respect,</p>
            <p>I am Behrad, a lazy student who doesn't study, skips classes, and doesn't even excuse his absences. Yet, despite all this, I already know most of the math concepts.</p>
            <p>Ms. Loprell, I wanted to thank you because you are an incredible teacher. Maybe I've only seen seven teachers in San Diego and many more in a country with a corrupt educational system. But the reason you are such a great teacher is not just your method of teaching math—not that you don't teach well, because that's not what I mean at all—but what you do for your students goes far beyond that.</p>
            <p>You made the class really comfortable for a shy and quiet person like me, who sometimes finds it hard to communicate with others, possibly due to language differences.</p>
            <p>Waking up at 8:30 in the morning and making it to class is tough, but without a doubt, you make every student in your class confident, even though they might lose their confidence for various reasons in other places. But let's be honest. How many students took the AP exam for your class? Well, that's because of that confidence you instill.</p>
            <p>During my school years in Iran, due to my academic conditions, I had truly outstanding teachers. One of them was perhaps the most famous teacher in all of Iran, and another, in addition to teaching us, also taught at the best university in Iran. Their teaching skills were undoubtedly unparalleled, and maybe that's what sparked my interest in math.</p>
            <p>But what you did was far beyond that. You made me interested in attending class and spending time in the classroom.</p>
            <p>Thank you for everything.</p>
            <p>How lucky are the students who, like me, get the chance to have you as their teacher.</p>
